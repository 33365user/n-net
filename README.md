# n-net

n-net was designed initally in mid 2022 and is a refined version of an earlier neural network program.

n-net is designed to serve as a foundational framework for creating and manipulating neural networks. Its intended use is to facilitate the construction, modification, and simulation of feedforward propagation in a simple neural network.
